# Project Title

I made this project to learn Django.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
sudo pip install Django
sudo pip3 install Django
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

First run this:

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
Then this [website link](http://127.0.0.1:8000/webapp/) should work and say "Hi!" to you.
